            When a college professor tells me that they never imagined their
            in-person course could be so engaging in an online format, or a
            student interacts with learning more online than they would have in
            the traditional classroom, I know that I, along with my incredibly
            talented team, are fulfilling our mission. We are Pearson's Learning
            Design Solutions (LDS) team, and our job is to reimagine traditional
            higher education courses for the online environment. Last year
            alone, we supported over 1,400 courses across 35+ programs for over
            a dozen of our university partners. We developed courses in
            disciplines such as Law, Social Work, Public Health, Education,
            Nursing, and Business, among others. It's a responsibility we take
            very seriously—not only to deliver amazing online learning—but to
            help safeguard the integrity and validity of the entire online
            education “galaxy.” It's no secret that online learning has had its
            naysayers, so if we prove them wrong while delivering,
            time-and-again, for students and academic partners... then, we
            fulfill our mission. With decades of expertise in online education
            and course development operations, LDS brings science and insight to
            ensure our college and university partners' online courses are
            designed and developed to meet the highest expectation of quality
            and efficacy. Our tenets are straightforward: Pedagogy: LDS brings
            data and science into designing courses to ensure they meet the
            appropriate rigor, engagement levels, and measurable outcomes. All
            instructional designers in LDS engage in regular professional
            development in the industry and hold various levels of certification
            in Quality Matters (QM). The team is currently supporting several
            partners in aligning courses to QM standards, including Regis
            College’s Nursing programs and Health Sciences programs. Equity: By
            designing through a lens of historically informed compassion and
            empathy, LDS consults to design courses with equity top of mind. LDS
            seeks ongoing team training opportunities in a commitment to raise
            diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) standards for online
            learning. LDS recently supported a university partner interested in
            auditing courses to identify ways to improve inclusivity in course
            content. All course components produced by LDS meet current WCAG 2.1
            AA and Pearson’s Global Content and Editorial Policy. Research: By
            participating in, and helping to conduct, ongoing research in online
            learning, LDS helps partners refine practices, innovate learning
            solutions, and keep up with generation after generation of digital
            learners. LDS is currently engaged in collaborative research with
            multiple partners, who are focused on developing learning analytics
            dashboards to advance data-driven learning design insight and
            practice. It's especially meaningful when faculty recognize that
            designing together with Pearson’s Learning Design Solutions team
            positively influences their course beyond project boundaries and
            into their regular teaching practices. A recent Brookings article,
            Online college classes can be better than in-person ones, reaffirms
